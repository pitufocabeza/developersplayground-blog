Sascha's personal website running on Gatsby, React and Node.js.

## Note

I've made my website open source for the purpose of your inspiration, motivation, and curiosity.

However, my site is highly customized and almost everything is tailored to my personal needs. It's not simply a theme.

**Therefore, I highly encourage you to be creative and create your own theme, design and content of course.**

The [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/) is a great place to start, and is the base for this blog.

## Features

- Posts and pages in Markdown
- Netlify CMS integrated

## Contribution

If you spot any typos or formatting errors in a post, or any other issue that
needs to be addressed, please don't hesitate to open a pull request and fix it!
